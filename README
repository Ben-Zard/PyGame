- Game - Sets up the environment, all of the balls, bricks, paddle, etc., and contains the game loop.

- Overlay - Draws the score and number of lives.

- Paddle - Is subclass of pygame.sprite.Sprite.
The image will just be a black rectangle.
The class should hold information about the size and movement speed of the rectangle that represents the paddle.
There should be methods to move the paddle left and right at that speed.
Movement should be capped so the paddle can't move off the screen.

- Ball - Is a subclass of pygame.sprite.Sprite.
The image will be a circle.
The balls will bounce off walls, the paddle, and bricks.
When a ball bounces off a brick, the brick will receive damage if 25.

- Brick - Is a subclass of pygame.sprite.Sprite.
The image will be a randomly chosen color.
You can do this by randomly choosing an int between 0-255 (inclusive) for each of the Red, Green, and Blue components.
The health of the brick will be set to 766 - the sum of those values (so 0,0,0 or black will have a health of 766 and 255,255,255 will have a health of 1).
Brick should have a hit method that removes 25 from its health and destroys itself if health goes to 0 or below.
